# Project Capstone

# To get started go in the terminal to the client folder and type the following command:

```
npm install
npm start
```

After the client has started on your local host, on the folder video you have the videos you should use for testing.

As an extra feature added to the app, you can make your videos public to everyone by clicking the toggle, but if you do so, anyone can access your videos as a result. But you also have the option to not click it and keep them private per user as it is specified in the requirements section.
